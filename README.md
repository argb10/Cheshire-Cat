Hi kitty - Alice said.

Hi, what are you doing here, little blondie? - said the cat.

Just trying to solve this CTF :( - said, Alice.

Hahaha, so you are here to beg for hints! If so, do tell - said the cat.

Please, please, please, a hint I must see, please don't get away from me - Alice said.

Do you know what a binary polyglot is? - ask the cat.

No - said, Alice.

Wonderful! Another ignorant fool to play with! - suddenly said the mad hatter appearing.

Don't mind him - said the cat.

A binary polyglot is a file that is valid with several file formats - explain the cat.

So? How does it help me? - asked Alice.

That is the part that you have to figure out, little blondie. See you in the other file! - said the cat leaving.

Bye dummy! - said the mad hatter also leaving.
