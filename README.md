Hi kitty - Alice said.

Hi, what are doing here little blondie? - said the cat.

Just trying to solve this CTF :( - said Alice.

Ha ha ha; so you are here begging for hints, if so do tell - said the cat.

Please, please, please a hint I must to see, please don't get away from me - Alice said.

Do you know what a binary polyglot is? - ask the cat.

No - said Alice.

Wonderful! Therefore, you are an ignorant and you are not working by yourself to change it! - said the mad hatter suddenly appearing.

Don't mind him - said the cat.

A binary polyglot is a file that is valid with several file formats - explain the cat.

So? How does it help me? - asked Alice.

That is the part that you have to figure out, little blondie. See you in the other file! - said the cat leaving.

Bye dummy! - said the mad hatter also leaving.
